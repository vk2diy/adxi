# Audio Summing

Two stereo lines need conversion to mono.

What's the best way to do this?

According to [this theory page](https://web.archive.org/web/20120509070136/https://www.rane.com/note109.html) the use of resistors is appropriate unless we are audiophiles.

Resistors provide the benefit of having frequency-independent response, unlike transformers.
