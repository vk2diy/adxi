## Timeline

 * Conceived: 2024-08-03
 * Designed: 2024-08-03 - 2024-10-10ish
 * Ordered: 2024-10-24
   * Cost: $41.40 for 10 boards + $154.20 for 10 pieces SMT = $195.60 for 10 pieces / 10 = $19.56 each (ex shipping)
   * Note that the ordering was delayed for 2 weeks or something owing to the late stage module design needing revision and wanting to share shipping costs, and this required updates to the classe2-calculator software.
 * ETA: 2024-11-06 roughly
